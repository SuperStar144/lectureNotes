HW 4 problem 6

p → q   equivalent to   ¬p ∨ q


p → q  ⊢  ¬p ∨ q **
    Top-level operator of conclusion is an OR
        Can I prove one side separately? Naaah
        As a backup, try PbC.
            Assume ¬(¬p ∨ q)
                If we had ¬p ∨ q, we would have a F
                    Try to prove just ¬p so can use OrI
                    Use NegI subproof
                        Assume pattern

                        Goal: F
            Goal: F

     



¬p ∨ q   ⊢  p → q
look at conclusion: top-level is →
ImplyI subproof
    Assume p
        Try OrE subproofs wiht premises
        Goal in both: q
    Goal: q



/////////////////////////

HW 4 problem 7

¬(p → q)    equivalent to   p ∧ ¬q


¬(p → q)  ⊢  p ∧ ¬q
Think about proving both sides separately - doesn't work
As a last resort, try PbC on the conclusion
    Assume ¬(p ∧ ¬q)
        If we had p → q, would contradict with premise
        Try ImplyI subproof to get p → q
            Assume p
                No obvious way to get q, try PbC
                Subproof, assume ¬q
                ImplyE
                Goal: false
            Goal: q
    Goal: F



p ∧ ¬q   ⊢   ¬(p → q)
Break apart the premise 
Use NegI subproof for conclusion
    Assume p → q 

    Goal: F


/////////////////////////

How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises 
        AND statement? use AndE1 and AndE2
        IMPLIES statement? left side of the implies: use ImplyE


3. Look at what you are trying to prove 
    (what do we look for in goal/conclusion?)
    look at top level operator - that will guide your approach

    ∧ - think of two sides as two separate proofs.
        Try to construct them both individually and put them together with AndI.

    ∨ - look at the two sides - can you prove one of them by themselves? If so, do that and use OrI1 or OrI2.

        See if you have an OR statement already. If you do, try OrE to build your conclusion.

    → - use ImplyI subproof. Assume left side of our goal, try to reach right side.

    ¬(something) - use NegI subproof. Assume "something", try to get F (contradiction).

    just a propositional atom? like p. 
        See where the atom appears in previous claims.
        Is it in the right side of an →? 
            Try to prove the left side of the → to use ImplyE.
        Do you have an OR statement as a claim? Try OrE to get your atom in both cases
        Can we get a F? use BottomE to conclude our atom.
        Try PbC subproof. Assume ¬p, try to get F.


After each claim - scan all avaliable information (including assumptions) and see if you can extract anything (AND,
    IMPLIES)



Inside a subproof - 
    (What are the different subproofs?)

    Goal at end of each
    OrE - both subproofs need to end with the same claim (which should be whatever I was trying to prove when I 
        opened the OrE subproofs)
    ImplyI - try to get to the right side of my goal imply statement
    PbC - F
    NegI - F

    after opening a subproof and writing down a goal, find the top level operator of that goal. Follow the same pattern
        to nest a subproof ot build that goal.

    --> when do we open a subproof?
        when you have one of the four subprooffs in mind.

    --> can we assume anything in a subproof? 
        can assume ANY one statement opening a subproof.

        but don't do it unless you have a pattern in mind.



Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above?

might hit a brick wall - need to try a different strategy.
    do you have an OR as a claim? Try OrE with it.
    nothing is working? Try PbC. Assume ¬(what you want) and try to get an F.



When to use BottomE? If you are using OrE and can't get your goal in one subproof but can get F, use BottomE to conclude
    what you want.

    DON'T use in PbC or NegI if you get F, even though you *could*. Won't help you finish the proof.

Bigger example: big.sc

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle. (LEM)

p ∨ ¬p



What would a theorem be in a truth table?
tautology



Prove LEM (lem.sc):

⊢ ( p ∨ ¬p )               //lem.sc



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of natural deduction in
    propositional logic

    "provable": prove using natural deduction
    "true": demonstrate an argument with truth tables


SOUNDNESS: ?? everything I can prove is actually true.

p ∧ q 
--------
p


COMPLETENESS: ?? I can prove everything that is true.

propositional logic deduction is both sound and complete.



--> what would it mean if a proof system was unsound?

bad!

--> what would it mean if a proof system was incomplete?

there are true arguments we can't prove.




Propositional logic is both SOUND and COMPLETE.



Using natural deduction to prove the sequent:
    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


Is equivalent to using truth tables to show that whenever
    P1, P2, ..., Pn
are true, then q is also true

(in-class quiz)

//////////////////////////////////////

Sets.

A set is an unordered collection of elements


{1,1,3,5,7} = {1,3,5,7} = {7,3,1,5}



∈: is in, exists in

    x ∈ A  means?

    x ∉ A  means?



Example: A = {1,4,7,11,20}

    1 ∈ A 
    2 ∉ A



- Common sets in math:

    ℕ: 
    ℤ: 
    ℚ: 
    ℝ: 
    ℂ: 
    ∅: 

ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ

////////////////////////////////////

Set builder notation.

: means, where, such that
| means the same thing

{variable : conditions}


{x: x ∈ ℕ, 5 ≤ x ≤ 10}

{5,6,7,8,9,10}

{k : k is a letter in "abracadabra"}



{x : x = 2k,  k ∈ ℕ}



{n : n = k^2, k ∈ Z}



{n : n = 3a + 1, a ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ a ≤ 4}



//////////////////////////////////////



Describe these sets in set builder notation


{5,10,15}



{CIS 115, CIS 200, CIS 300, CIS 301}



{2,4,8,16,32}


///////////////////////////////////////
∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

///////////////////////////////////////

Set union, ⋃

The union of the sets A and B, written A ⋃ B, is the set
of all elements....?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋃ B =


//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

Set intersection, ⋂

The intersection of the sets A and B, written A ⋂ B, is the set
of all elements that are...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋂ B =

///////////////////////////////////////

Set difference,

/ or \ (means the same thing)

The difference between the sets A and B, written A - B, is the set
of all elements...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A - B =

//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

A = {1,3,7,10,11,12}

B = {2,3,4,5,6,7}


Find:

A ⋃ B =

A ⋂ B =

A - B =

B - A =


//////////////////

Subset - A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if
    all elements in A are also in B.

(We say A ⊂ B if A is a subset of B but A ≠ B.)




Example:

A = {1,3,4}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?



A = {8,1,3}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?
